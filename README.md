# SIO
SIO coding language! (Selective Introspection Order)

# Getting Started
Start by downloading the .exe file and adding it to your PATH variable!
To write your first program just boot up the file via command prompt or opening the exe, after that go ahead and type in `print < hello world! > ;`, press enter and there you have it, your very first program!
If you want to run a program from a `.sio` file just type in `LOAD` press enter and then paste the path of the file that you want to run in `LOAD: ` and `TARRP: ` and you should be good to go (eg. paste the file path for `t.sio`)

# Syntax
Lets start with strings: the `<` and `>` are used in place of quotes in SIO, also keep in mind SPACES ARE INTEGRAL, because of the way that SIO works you can't have to many (or to little) spaces. As in: `print < practice > ;` is not the same as `print<practice> ;` or `print <practice> ;`.
